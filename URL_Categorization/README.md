# URL Categorization Script
This Python script categorizes URLs from a given input file into different types based on their file extensions. It separates URLs into JavaScript, image, CSS, and other URLs, and saves them into respective output files


The script will categorize the URLs and save them into separate output files:

js.txt: JavaScript URLs
img.txt: Image URLs
css.txt: CSS URLs
others.txt: URLs that don't fall into the above categories
